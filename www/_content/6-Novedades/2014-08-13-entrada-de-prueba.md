<p>Ed Catmull is the president of both Pixar and Disney Animation Studios. He is an innovator in technological and creative spaces, and this book is an entertaining and informative look behind-the-scenes of some of today's most popular animated films. What impresses me most about Catmull, however, is his ability to keep high spirits amongst his team, even in face of the threat of low morale. Definitely a book to encourage and empower anyone who works with a team, especially those in the creative spaces.</p>
