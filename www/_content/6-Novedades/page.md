Along our journey we encountered nothing but incredible scenes that needed capturing.
I felt as though I wasn't so much *taking* photos as I was *receiving* visual bounties from the landscape around me.
"Never forget this," it begged. And I haven't.

Although I'm mostly a private person, I feel compelled to share the beauty in the imagery I captured that day with the world.
